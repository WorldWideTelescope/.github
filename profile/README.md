# WorldWide Telescope

**WorldWide Telescope (WWT) is a tool for showcasing astronomical data and
knowledge.** It’s not a physical telescope — it’s a suite of free and open
source software and data sets that combine to create stunning scientific
visualizations and stories. The WWT ecosystem includes a [Windows
application][win], an [interactive web app][webclient], and toolkits for
[Python][pywwt] and [TypeScript/JavaScript][tsjs].

The [American Astronomical Society][aas] (AAS) is a founding sponsor of the
WorldWide Telescope project and assisted with its transition from a commercial
to an Open Source effort. Significant financial, administrative, and
programmatic support enabled the fully open realization of this amazing
resource, which continues to be utilized throughout the astronomical community
for a variety of educational and research-related efforts.
